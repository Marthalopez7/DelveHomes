            <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>The machine has all the latest technology to make residents comfortable all the time. The Blue Plate is an excellent example of this. It allows residents to talk to each other, even if they are a million miles away! It uses hologram technology so that you are able to see and hear another resident. In addition, inside a room, residents are able to push a button and activate music in the room. The music can be adjusted to a   resident's preferences and provide comfort to them. Furthermore,  there are buttons that also prepare the bath for residents. All this technology has provided residents with maximum comfort and satisfaction.</p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>One resident, Vashti, loves living in the machine and never wants to leave her room. She describes her experience in the machine to be wonderful and excellent. She loves the isolation feature integrated in her room and also uses the blue tablet to teach lectures. Vashti enjoys living with so much technology and feels as though she does not need to worry about her needs, as the machine takes care of all of them. </p>
