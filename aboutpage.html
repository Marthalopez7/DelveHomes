            <h3>History</h3> 
             <p>The machine was built a long time ago by three different creators. Andrea Picquadio, the main engineer, Christina Morillo the main founder, and Italo Melo the UX designer. They are the creators of the machine and everything that goes along with it. Since their passing, different people have each learned one part of the machine and specialize in the section. They are the ones that keep the machine in its most pristine condition. Thus, keeping the machine fit for many future generations to use. </p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
             <p>Technology inside the machine provides residents with a luxury experience. The high tech living spaces available to residents come with ample amounts of buttons. Residents are provided with a button that allows you to call for aid. Simply pressing that button will allow injured persons to receive medicine. These living spaces are also illuminated with ambient lighting and soundproofed for residents' pleasure. Overall, residents really enjoy living in the machine and enjoy their high-tech lives.</p>
