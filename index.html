            <h3>The Machine</h3>
            <p>The Machine has perfect cozy sized homes. The new honeycomb designs were made to be compact and comfortable even while underground. The best part is that these homes come equipped with dozens of accommodating buttons, which make up for the small spacing. Examples of such are buttons for a bath, food, and music. Use of buttons will vary depending on the resident, but manuals will always be provided. There is also great service installed for long distance communication. Residents will not have to leave into the outside world to communicate with others. It's all provided at the click of a button. No physical labor is needed either since those magnificent buttons can do anything with a press. Previous residents have stated The Machine honeycombs are such an enjoyable experience they forgot they were underground. Everything they needed for living was provided with buttons. Replacements for things such as medical checkups or physical strength are included. Each home has its own set of top tier medication so residents may stay in the comfort of their own homes. These homes may not be for everyone, but they are incredible forms of advancement. There is no need for personal skills or talents, the advanced technology will make everything easier to live in. This home truly has it all!</p>

            <h3>Daily Life</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the machine! Inside the machine is a wonderful living space fit for anyone wanting to live in a world that is more technologically advanced. These living spaces are built with multiple different buttons to adjust for a personâ€™s needs. Each button has a different function. Each room comes with a manual describing the actions of each function. This way there will not be any confusion about what button activates which function.  Just one click of a button and food will appear in the rooms! Some other functions of these buttons include an isolation button. This button allows a person to go into a mode where no one is able to reach them. It's perfect for days when someone might want some peace and quiet. In addition, communication is easier inside the machine. To communicate with people across the world, use the blue tablet. With this tablet you can see the other person as well as hear them. Not only are these living spaces super technologically advanced, they also have built in beds which are very customizable. These beds can be summoned at any time. There is no specific time or place where you need to summon these beds. These living spaces are built in a hexagonal shape, the rooms mimic the interior of a bee hive!  Here in the machine, excellence and comfort are the goals.</p>
