            <h3>Affordability</h3>
                <p>Rooms inside the machine are affordable to incoming residents and are worth their price! Living spaces start at $100,000. Prices can increase based on customizations. Residents are free to move in the same day they purchase the room inside the machine if no customizations were purchased. All sales are final and no refunds can be made.

                <h3>Assistive Technology</h2>
                <p>Technology inside the machine is very advanced and made to serve every resident's needs. An example of this would be the button that will draw residents their bath. It will fill the tub with the water of a perfect temperature. Afterwards, residents may press a button to summon a delicious meal, prepped with all the nutrition a person may need.</p>

                <h3>The Surface</h3>
                <p>Here in the machine, residents are open to visit the surface! To visit the surface you must head to the vomitories and receive a respirator along with an Egression-permit. With the respirator residents are able to freely explore the Earth’s surface with ease, the air becomes easier to breathe. Most residents prefer to stay inside their living spaces, however, some do enjoy going out and viewing the Earth’s Surface.</p>

                <h3>The Airship</h3>
                <p>The machine also has its very own airship to take residents to whichever destination they would like. Residents are able to fly across the world with ease. To arrive at the airship residents just follow the tunnel out and then they can board the airship. Residents are able to look out the windows to see the views of the Earth’s surface if they would like to. Flight attendants are also available to passengers who would like to learn a few facts and to serve their needs. </p>
